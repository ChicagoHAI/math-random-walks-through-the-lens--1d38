> Establishes an equivalence between cryptographic security properties and game-theoretic equilibria in random walks, providing a unified framework for analyzing security protocols.

## Abstract

This paper establishes a novel connection between cryptographic security games and game-theoretic analysis of random walks. We introduce a unified framework that bridges these seemingly disparate perspectives, demonstrating how security properties in cryptography can be recast as equilibrium strategies in repeated games with random walk dynamics. Our main results show that several cryptographic hardness assumptions have natural interpretations as Nash equilibria in appropriately constructed games. We provide applications to the analysis of commitment schemes and zero-knowledge proofs, offering new insights into their security properties through the lens of game theory.

## Key Contributions

1. Security properties in cryptographic protocols are equivalent to Nash equilibria in corresponding game-theoretic random walks
2. Convergence rates of security game random walks match the convergence of best-response dynamics in their game-theoretic counterparts
3. Parallel composition of secure random walks preserves security parameters
