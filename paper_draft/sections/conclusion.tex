\section{Conclusion}

This paper has established a rigorous connection between cryptographic and game-theoretic perspectives on random walks. Our main results demonstrate that security properties can be naturally recast as game-theoretic equilibria, providing new tools for protocol analysis.

Future work could explore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extensions to quantum random walks
    \item Applications to other cryptographic primitives
    \item Computational complexity implications
    \item Connections to learning theory
\end{itemize}
