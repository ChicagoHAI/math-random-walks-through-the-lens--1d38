\section{Applications}

\subsection{Commitment Schemes}

Our framework provides new insights into the security of commitment schemes. Consider a commitment scheme as a random walk where the state space represents possible commitments and reveals.

\begin{example}[Pedersen Commitment]
The Pedersen commitment scheme can be analyzed as a random walk on the group $\Z_p^*$, where transitions correspond to the committer's choices of randomness.
\end{example}

\subsection{Zero-Knowledge Proofs}

Our results apply naturally to zero-knowledge protocols, where the interaction between prover and verifier can be modeled as a random walk.

\begin{example}[Graph Isomorphism Protocol]
In the graph isomorphism zero-knowledge proof, the random walk occurs on the space of graph permutations, with transition probabilities determined by the prover's randomization strategy.
\end{example}
