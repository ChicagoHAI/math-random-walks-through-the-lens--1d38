This paper establishes a novel connection between cryptographic security games and game-theoretic analysis of random walks. We introduce a unified framework that bridges these seemingly disparate perspectives, demonstrating how security properties in cryptography can be recast as equilibrium strategies in repeated games with random walk dynamics. Our main results show that several cryptographic hardness assumptions have natural interpretations as Nash equilibria in appropriately constructed games. We provide applications to the analysis of commitment schemes and zero-knowledge proofs, offering new insights into their security properties through the lens of game theory.
